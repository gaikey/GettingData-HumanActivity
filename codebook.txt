Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.


The factor variables in the data set are "subject" and "activity"
The "activity" values measure, which are self-explanatory, are:
- LAYING
- SITTING
- STANDING
- WALKING
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
The "subject" variable is simply a number (as a factor) that identifies the subject associated with the measurements

The other 66 variables are numeric and measured or derived from measurements with an accelerometer or a gyroscope


##
## First Data Set Variables
##

The 66 numeric variable names can be interpreted based on the following.

The first 4 letters of the variable name indicate whether the measurement is a:
- time domain signal "Time" or
- frequency domain signal "Freq"

The acceration signal is separated into "body" and "gravity" components and are identified after the "Time"/"Freq" as
- body component = "Body"
- gravity component = "Gravity"

The measurement type from the accelerometer or gyroscope is identified by "Acc" and "Gyro" respectively

For some measurements, the the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals identified by "Jerk"

Each vector is broken up into x, y and z components identified by a variable ending in "X", "Y" and "Z" respectively

Some measurements are the magnitude of the vector and are calculated using the Euclidean norm and identified by "Mag"

Every measurement is either a mean or standard deviation and identified by "Mean" or "Stddev" respectively


subject			A number from 1-30 representing a particular individual. It is a factor variable
activity		One of six activities measured (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

## Second Data Set Variables
##

The second data set aggregates the data set described above by the factor features "activity" and "subject"
The value for the 66 numeric features is the average by the "activity" and "subject"
There are 35 rows returned representing the unique "activity"/"subject" combinations
